# Write a program that N number of Fibonnaci numbers where N equals the user input

#Objective:useing functions and user input

#*Tip: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,

curNum = 1
prevNum = 0
n = input("Please input the number of numbers you would like to print out:\n")
print(1)
for x in range(int(n)):
  temp = curNum
  curNum += prevNum
  prevNum = temp
  
  
  print(str(curNum))
